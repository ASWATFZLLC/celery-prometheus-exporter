The initial release of celery-prometheus-exporter was intended as a minimal
solution that would cover what I personally needed at my own projects. That
being said, you might need completely different kinds of metrics being
exposed. If you do, please feel free to create tickets and pull requests ðŸ™‚ As
such, the more details you can provide in your tickets the better.

I will try to look into each issue but please note that I might not be available
all the time and that timezones exist. Please be patient ðŸ˜Š
